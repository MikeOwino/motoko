# M0200

This error means that the compiler encountered a subtyping, equivalence or constructor equivalence problem that it cannot decide is true or false in a timely manner.

This is due to a limitation of the type system and may require you to rewrite
some of your code to avoid the problem.

The most like cause is a recursive type or class whose definition involves
instantiating the type or class with nested type parameters.

For example, this definition of `Box<T>`

``` motoko
class Box<T>(v : T) {
  public let value = t;
  public func map<R>(f : T -> R) : Box<R> {
     Box<R>(f t)
  };
}
```
is problematic because `Box<R>` is instantiated at `R`, an inner type parameter, while

``` motoko
class Box<T>(v : T) {
  public let value = v;
  public func map(f : T -> T) : Box<T> {
     Box<T>(f value)
  };
}
```
is accepted (but also less useful).

Another workaround is to define the problematic method as a separate
function, outside of the class:

``` motoko
class Box<T>(v : T) {
  public let value = v
};

func map<T, R>(b : Box<T>, f : T -> R) : Box<R> {
  Box<R>(f(b.value))
};
```
